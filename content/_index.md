# Teaching

From 2017 through 2021, I taught an introductory biostatistics course for UCSF's [Master of Science in Global Health program](https://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/education/masters-program). In Winter 2019 and Fall 2019, I taught an introductory course on [R](https://r-project.org) for UCSF's [Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://epibiostat.ucsf.edu).

# Projects

I maintain [interactive visualizations of COVID-19 data](https://covid-19.rbind.io) and [R code for scraping data](https://github.com/yea-hung/hsd) on US homeless shelters.

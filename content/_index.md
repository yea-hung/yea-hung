I am an epidemiologist at the [University of California, San Francisco](https://ucsf.edu) (UCSF).

# Teaching

I teach an introductory biostatistics course for UCSF's [Master of Science in Global Health program](https://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/education/masters-program). In Winter 2019 and Fall 2019, I taught an introductory course on [R](https://r-project.org) for UCSF's [Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://epibiostat.ucsf.edu).

# Research

My research currently focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on mortality in California. We have published five papers on the topic:

- Wrigley-Field E, Kiang MV, Riley AR, Barbieri M, **Chen Y-H**, Duchowny KA, Matthay EC, Van Riper D, Jegathesan K, Bibbins-Domingo K, Leider JP. [Geographically targeted COVID-19 vaccination is more equitable and averts more deaths than age-based thresholds alone](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abj2099). *Sci Adv*. 2021;7(40):eabj2099.
- Riley AR, **Chen Y-H**, Matthay EC, Glymour MM, Torres JM, Fernandez A, Bibbins-Domingo K. [Excess mortality among Latino people in California during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100860). *SSM Popul Health*. 2021;15:100860.
- **Chen Y-H**, Glymour M, Riley A, Balmes J, Duchowny K, Harrison R, Matthay E, Bibbins-Domingo K. [Excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among Californians 18-65 years of age, by occupational sector and occupation: March through November 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252454). *PLoS One*. 2021;16(6):e0252454. 
- **Chen Y-H**, Glymour MM, Catalano R, Fernandez A, Nguyen T, Kushel M, Bibbins-Domingo K. [Excess mortality in California during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, March to August 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.7578). *JAMA Intern Med*. 2021;181(5):705-707.
- Catalano R, Glymour MM, **Chen Y-H**, Bibbins-Domingo K. [Sheltering in place and the likelihood of nonnatural death](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab062). *Am J Epidemiol*. 2021;190(6):1075-1080. 

We have additionally released [two policy briefs](https://epibiostat.ucsf.edu/news/california-covid-related-deaths-research-policy-briefs) on the COVID-19 pandemic in California.
